With each passing year, open source software is more firmly establishing itself as the bedrock upon which the modern technology is built. Internet giants and small startups alike are leveraging existing open source projects as components of their software products and infrastructure, enabling them to launch new products at a greater speed and a lower cost than ever before.

Despite its crucial function, work on open source software is often underappreciated and underfunded, relying on the work of individual volunteers. Even critical core infrastructures projects can grow in popularity (like OpenSSL, the foundation of much of web's cryptography, had until recently its development team [a two person development team and a dog](https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/453501860457230336)).

There is something intrinsically rewarding about developing open source projects: pursuing novel, intellectually stimulating ideas, sharing the results one's craft and, for established projects, becoming part of a community of like-minded individuals. However, with success comes responsibility and work on a growing open source project also includes responding to user requests, fixing bugs, implmenting new features, maitaining compatibility with your dependencies, implementing tests or writing documentation. The projects which handle the transtion have potential to become

The field of quantum computing is in large building upon the successfully established open source development models, and we are happy to report that the community has embraced open source software. However, we are still in the early days of establishing the technology stack for future quantum software developers and while some of the components of the critical infrastructure is developed by larger development teams with commercial backing, there are plentiful individuals who are helping shape the building blocks of the foundations upon which the quantum computing software industry is going to rely in the decades to come.
