       <b>Tomas Babej</b>
       is a serial open source project author and maintainer. He became infatuated with the spirit of open source at a very early age while being employed at Red Hat, where motivated by the fear of public shaming on mailing lists he absorbed the best practices for conducting open source software development and governing open source communities. Tomas loves how open source enables him to tweak every little piece of his setup and hopes to maintain this capability even when playing with quantum computing hardware.

    <div class='col-md-8' style='text-align: justify;'>
       <b>Mark Fingerhuth</b> wants to rid his life of as much third-party and proprietary software as possible through the use of open source software in all aspects of his life - be it his phone, 3D printer, laptop or smart speakers. He loves popularizing the term <i>quantum software engineer</i> and with the <a href="https://github.com/qosf/os_quantum_software">list of open source quantum software projects on GitHub</a> he kickstarted the effort to enumerate and categorize all existing quantum software projects in our observable universe. In his day-to-day life, Mark is the CEO of <a href="https://proteinqure.com">ProteinQure</a> whose goal it is to demonstrate the world's first useful application of quantum/classical hybrid computation in pharmaceutical drug discovery.

       <b>Michał Stęchły</b> got into open source thanks to quantum computing - when he discovered he can contribute to the quantum computing community as a newcomer to the field, he immediately fell in love with the idea. He authored and supported open source implementations and research of several quantum computing algorithms. Michał has also a blog <a href="www.mustythoughts.com">"Musty Thoughts"</a>, which aims to help people get into the realm of quantum computing. Professionally, he is a Quantum Software Engineer at <a href="www.zapatacomputing.com">Zapata Computing</a>.

    <div class='col-md-8' style='text-align: justify;'>
       <b>Maggie Li</b> loves all things open source, from science to software,
       as a believer in innovation through collaboration. She stepped into the
       world of open source software as a quantum computing amateur by
       contributing to <a
       href="https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane">PennyLane's</a>
       library/tutorials, thanks to QOSF's Quantum Mentorship Program. Outside
       of quantum computing, she also enjoys UI/UX design and hopes to
       intersect the two in the future to make quantum computing education more
       accessible to younger quantum enthusiasts like high school students.
       Recently, she also interned at the Bank of Canada's Quantum Lab as a
       summer student research assistant.

    <div class='col-md-8' style='text-align: justify;'>
        <b>Peter Wittek<sup>&#8224;</sup></b> is a life-long fan of free and open source software and he gets furious every time he has to fill in a PDF form that does not work on Linux. When he is not preaching about the importance of open source software, he pursues research on the borderline of artificial intelligence and quantum physics as an Assistant Professor in the University of Toronto, and as an affiliate in the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. He is also the Academic Director of the Quantum Stream in the Creative Destruction Lab, where he sees dozens of startups exploring ideas using quantum computers and the corresponding software stack.
