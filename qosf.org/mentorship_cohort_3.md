##### **Parallel and distributed low-depth algorithms for quantum amplitude estimation** 

*Project description*: Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) is a core subroutine in quantum computation with various applications, including Monte Carlo integration. Quantum computers can potentially utilize QAE to achieve quadratic speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo. In the conventional approach, the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm is used for amplitude estimation; however, QPE requires expensive controlled operations as well as a Fourier transform, which currently lead to difficulties with implementation in near-term quantum devices. In response to this, some alternative lower depth algorithms have been developed. In this project, I focused on implementing a parallelized and distributed version of the Power Law algorithm for QAE, which should further reduce the current hardware challenges by interconnecting small quantum computers as opposed to relying on a single big quantum computer.

An exact quantum simulation will allow us to access not only the ground state but also the full spectrum of many-body systems.

##### **Variational Embeddings in Quantum Machine Learning**

*Project description*: Machine Learning is a potential application for near-term intermediate scale quantum computers with possible speed-ups over their classical counterparts. Quantum classifiers are quantum circuits that can be trained to classify data in two stages; 1) Embedding: the input data is encoded into quantum states, embedding it to a high-dimensional Hilbert space. 2) Measurement: A quantum measurement of the circuit to discriminate between classes. Usually, the measurement part of the circuit is trained but in a [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03622) an alternate approach has been adopted where the embedding part of the circuit is trained instead, freeing up more precious resources. In this work, we benchmark various embeddings and cost functions and propose improvements.
